/*********************************************************/

Aspects correctly implemented:

brightness.c - correctly prints the average brightness of 
a grayscale image on a scale of 0 to 1.

readaline.c - correctly reads a line of any size from a 
filestream, stores it, and returns the number of bytes
in the line.

simlines.c - correctly prints the similar lines in one
or more files.

valgrind reports that several blocks (corresponding to the
number of atoms created) are still in the heap at exit.
This is because there is no way to free the memory
allocated for each atom (as per the spec).
There are no other memory leaks.
